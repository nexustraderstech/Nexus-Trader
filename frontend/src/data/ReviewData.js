      "Learning in nexus trades was a very good experience ! The teaching was very good and concepts were taught easily . The prices are affordable. Outside people take too many high charges also the concepts they do not teach repeatedly but here individual attention and doubts sessions helped us for a strong foundation / base for trading and these things remain with us forever so the prices are affordable . I enjoyed learning here it was a good experience and I will soon start trading ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüòÅ",

      " Well the experience was too good with Nexustraders‚ö°, At first I was little confused about joining the course but when I attended the beginners course it changed my mind to join the course, Talking about the course the concept Nexustraders taught was straight on point üí¢ , learning throughout the course was pretty seamless like anytime I came up with any query Nexustraders were ready to help all the time, the best thing I enjoyed was live trading and market analysis session , it helped me to boost up my confidence , I don't think any other class will provide this kind of teaching and support at such low cost‚ö°",

There is not only teaching but they also taught facts and sometimes it will be fun also.",

    content: "The Nexus trading Course is the perfect start to anyone who is interested in trading, with little or even no understanding of the subject. This course gets you all the essentials to help you understand how to trade and what mistakes to avoid. I found the course to be excellent in terms of both content & clarity. I would not recommend anyone to begin trading the markets without first having undertaken their course. I attended the seminar and realized that it will be very helpful to attend a training session with them if I have to start trading. I registered for the Beginners trading course and I realized that here at Nexus trading they have made it so simple that a fresher like me was also confident to trade after the course. Our mentors gave us such simple and easy strategies to identify and take trades so that we keep away from the wrong trades and take up only the correct ones. I am totally satisfied with the training and continuous support given from Nexus traders after the course. Big thanks to the whole team of Nexus traders.‚ù§Ô∏è",
